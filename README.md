# Godot Bootstrap

*Godot Bootstrap* provides basic components to make setting up an
initial [Godot](//http://www.godotengine.org)
game much faster, by providing much of the boiler plate code to get you
started.  Best of all, you can decide which components to use, and which
to ignore.



## Components

Some of the components that bootstrap provides:

* [Modules](components/modules) a system for allowing user mods, or
  developer-provided DLC, to extend the basic game.
* [User Configuration](components/user_config) tools for storing and
  retrieving user-set configuration values.
* [Save Games](components/save_game) components for maintaining saved
  games.
* *Extended GUI components* GUI components to help make the UI aspects
  work nicely together.



## Using Bootstrap

Bootstrap provides a set of components to provide basic functionality to
your game, and the tools to import those components into your game.  Bootstrap
requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release) to run.

## Automated Testing

Modern software is complex.  The horsepower of computers allows us to build
games with hundreds of systems.  This also means that there's many places
where the game can break.  To aleviate the problem of adding a whole QA team
to find the little issues, automated tests help to make sure small parts of
the system are working as intended.



## Contributing

*Godot Bootstrap* is still very much under development.  You can use the
GitHub project for pull requests your local changes.  Be sure to have a
