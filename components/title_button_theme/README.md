# Theme: `title_button_theme`

A simple theme that strips off the border and background from the buttons.

**Category**: `themes`


## Usage

Create a new custom theme and select the `title_button_theme.gd` as the
corresponding script object.

This will cause the buttons that inherit this theme to be displayed with
the theme's fonts and highlight colors (hover, active, disabled, etc),
but with no background.


## Extending

If you want to use this as the basis for more changes to the theme, you can
either sub-class this theme, or just copy the code into your theme.
